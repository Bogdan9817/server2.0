### DISCONNECT LOGIC

Have to decide game session behaviour after player leave game.

## RECORD STATISTIC

Nice to have mechanism that every hour or even less get current connected sockets and save it into db.

Also is good to check which cards are more/less popular for future editing.

## GAME UPDATES

Write logic for cards opts and room options.

Spread cards into 3 types "verb" | "noun" | "phrase" and create mechanism that would balance cards during the game that the player will have equal number of cards of each type.
